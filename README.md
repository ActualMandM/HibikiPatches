# HibikiPatches
**NOTICE:** The Persona modding community has created a [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) mod named [Unreal Essentials](https://github.com/AnimatedSwine37/UnrealEssentials) which patches out the UTOC Signature for many Unreal games, including Hi-Fi RUSH. Please use that instead.

---

An ASI plugin for [Hi-Fi RUSH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230) that implements the following features:
 - Narknon and Praydog's [UTOC Signature Bypass](https://www.nexusmods.com/hifirush/mods/1) exe patch
 - Removing the letter/pillar box that can appear on non-16:9 displays

This requires [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader), recommended to be under `dsound.dll`.

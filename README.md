# HibikiPatches
An ASI plugin for [Hi-Fi RUSH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230) that implements the following features:
 - Narknon and Praydog's [UTOC Signature Bypass](https://www.nexusmods.com/hifirush/mods/1) exe patch
 - Removing the letter/pillar box that can appear on non-16:9 displays

This requires [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader), recommended to be under `dsound.dll`.
